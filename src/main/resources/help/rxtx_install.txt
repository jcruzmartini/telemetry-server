RxTx Installation

The official RxTx binary pack is available here. The provided link will download the distro with some standard binaries (
for linux 32bit, 64 bit, etc). If binaries for your specific operating system are not included, you may consider recompiling RxTx yourselves.

For a custom Win64 RxTx distro, have a look at the CloudHopper's web site.

To install it, unzip the distribution file in a temporary place and do the following copies:

File RXTXcomm.jar should go under JDKDIR/jre/lib/ext/
The necessary library (e.g.. for Linux 32bit, the librxtxSerial.so) should go under JDKDIR/jre/bin/
If you have a separate JRE directory, do the same copies for the JREDIR directory!

IMPORTANTE: LOS .so VAN UBICADOS EN JDKDIR/jre/bin/ Y en JDKDIR/jre/lib/i386
