Java Comm Installation

The installation procedure for both the old Java Comm v2 and the new Java Comm v3 is identical.

Java Comm v2 is for Win32 systems and it is available on the Download page.

Java Comm v3 is for Linux systems and it is available for download directly from SUN downloads (registration is required)

To install it, unzip the downloaded archive file in a temporary place and do the following copies:

File comm.jar should go under JDKDIR/jre/lib/ext/
File javax.comm.properties should go under JDKDIR/jre/lib/
Library files (i.e. win32com.dll for Win32 or the .so Linux library files) should go under JDKDIR/jre/bin/
If you have a separate JRE directory, do the same copies for the JREDIR directory!


IMPORTANTE: LOS .so VAN UBICADOS EN JDKDIR/jre/bin/ Y en JDKDIR/jre/lib/i386
